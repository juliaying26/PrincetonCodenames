# TRA 301 Final Project

## Julia Ying & Nora Graves

### Setup:

Backend:

- Open a terminal for the backend.
- `cd backend`.
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run `python game.py` to start the backend (Flask) server.

Frontend:

- Keep the backend terminal running and open a new terminal for the frontend.
- `cd frontend`.
- Run `npm install` (make sure you are in `frontend`). This will install a `node_modules` folder inside `frontend` which is not and should not be pushed to repo.
- Run `npm run dev` to start the frontend (Vite) server.

Navigate to `localhost:5173` to see the webpage.
